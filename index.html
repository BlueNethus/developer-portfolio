            <h3>The Mandalorians the bounty hunters</h3>
            <p>Mandalorians are fictional people associated with the planet Mandalore in the Star Wars universe and
                franchise created by George Lucas. Their most distinct cultural feature is their battle helmet, chest
                armor,
                wrist gauntlets, and often jet packs, similar to those used by Boba Fett and his father/clone host,
                Jango
                Fett.</p>

            <p>At some point during the Galactic Civil War, between the events of Rebels (5–2 BBY) and Return of the
                Jedi (4 ABY), the Empire returned to Mandalore and purged the Mandalorian people, leaving only a few
                surviving clans and stealing large quantities of the precious Beskar metal, which no blaster or
                lightsaber can penetrate; this event became known as the "Great Purge" among Mandalorians.[16] The
                Mandalorian follows the exploits of Din Djarin, aka the Mandalorian or simply "Mando," a bounty hunter
                not originally from Mandalore. He was orphaned on another planet during the Clone Wars (22–19 BBY) when
                Separatist battle droids killed his parents; saved by a Mandalorian clan called "The Tribe", Djarin was
                adopted as a Foundling and raised with their Creed ("the Way of the Mandalore", or simply "the
                Way").[16][15] The Yoda-like toddler that he adopts, Grogu aka The Child, is also considered a
                foundling, but Djarin decides to return it to the Jedi after discovering it is Force-sensitive.</p>
