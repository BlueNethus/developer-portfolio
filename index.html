            <h3>The Mandalorians the bounty hunters</h3>
            <p>Mandalorians are fictional people associated with the planet Mandalore in the Star Wars universe and
                franchise created by George Lucas. Their most distinct cultural feature is their battle helmet, chest
                armor,
                wrist gauntlets, and often jet packs, similar to those used by Boba Fett and his father/clone host,
                Jango
                Fett.</p>

            <p>At some point during the Galactic Civil War, between the events of Rebels (5–2 BBY) and Return of the
                Jedi (4 ABY), the Empire returned to Mandalore and purged the Mandalorian people, leaving only a few
                surviving clans and stealing large quantities of the precious Beskar metal, which no blaster or
                lightsaber can penetrate; this event became known as the "Great Purge" among Mandalorians.[16] The
                Mandalorian follows the exploits of Din Djarin, aka the Mandalorian or simply "Mando," a bounty hunter
                not originally from Mandalore. He was orphaned on another planet during the Clone Wars (22–19 BBY) when
                Separatist battle droids killed his parents; saved by a Mandalorian clan called "The Tribe", Djarin was
                adopted as a Foundling and raised with their Creed ("the Way of the Mandalore", or simply "the
                Way").[16][15] The Yoda-like toddler that he adopts, Grogu aka The Child, is also considered a
                foundling, but Djarin decides to return it to the Jedi after discovering it is Force-sensitive.</p>

                <p>According to Bo-Katan Kryze in "Chapter 11: The Heiress", Djarin was found by the "Children of the
                    Watch", a group of religious zealots who follow the ancient "Way of the Mandalore", consisting of
                    various forgotten Mandalorian traditions, such as never removing their helmets in front of others;
                    they
                    were excluded from the mainstream of Mandalorian society for trying to spread their beliefs.[15]
                    Djarin
                    thus finds out he's part of an extremist group without ever having known it; he was raised by The
                    Armorer to believe only people who choose to follow the Creed are Mandalorians.[15] But this
                    confrontation with Kryze's group of Nite Owls revealed that there were also other Mandalorians who
                    were
                    Mandalorian by ancestry, which share some cultural ideas and practices with the Watch such as
                    wearing
                    Mandalorian armour, but have no rule against removing one's helmet.[15]</p>

                <p>Moff Gideon, leading a faction of ex-Imperials, was personally involved in the Great Purge and
                    obtained
                    the Darksaber (a weapon symbolising dynastic authority on Mandalore) from Bo-Katan after defeating
                    her
                    in combat.[15] During the show's second season, it is revealed that Bo-Katan, along with a small
                    number
                    of Mandalorian warriors willing to follow her, is attempting to reclaim the Darksaber and liberate
                    Mandalore from Imperial occupation.[15] In the season two finale, Djarin defeats Moff Gideon in
                    combat,
                    thus becoming the rightful owner of the Darksaber and the legitimate ruler of Mandalore, which
                    Bo-Katan
                    accepts; even though Djarin is not interested in ruling and would rather pass the Darksaber to her
                    as
                    they intended, she insists she needs to obtain it through combat.[17] The season thus ends with a
                    cliffhanger, as Djarin could either help Bo-Katan and her forces liberate Mandalore in exchange for
                    their assistance in taking down Gideon, or they could become hostile over possession of the
                    Darksaber
                    and ideological differences.[17] Despite his loyalty to the Creed-following Mandalorians who raised
                    him,
                    Djarin seems ever more open to Bo-Katan's Mandalorian views of the Way, as illustrated by his new
                    willingness to remove his helmet on several public occasions.[17]</p>
